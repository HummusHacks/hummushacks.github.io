<h1>Hack Ideas</h1>
<p>
  Having trouble thinking a project? Brainstorm with these hack ideas!
</p>

<h3>Automation</h3>
<p>
  Automate your hummus creation, serving, shopping, etc. Automate tasks you might do daily, 
  like searching every hummus brand website for new flavors. 
</p>

<h3>Web</h3>
<p>
  Think about how people use the internet for tasks related to hummus. How could you make these tasks more convenient with a web site or service?
</p>

<h3>AI / ML & Data Science</h3>
<p>
  Use AI or ML to model different aspects of the hummus industry. Perhaps find the best ingredient combo, 
  or find trends in hummus purchases by frequency or location to predict demand and adequately stock shelves. 
  Don’t forget, you’ll have access to extensive datasets provided by our sponsors.

<h3>Design</h3>
