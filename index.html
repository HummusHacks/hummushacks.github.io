          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
          Hummus Hacks is a 24 hour hackathon based entirely around hummus. Like traditional hackathons, 
          we provide an environment where passionate people come together to solve problems using technology. 
          Your project can be anything you imagine as long as it is entirely created in the 24 hours of the event. 
          We encourage you to learn something new and incorporate technology you’ve never used before into your project.
          </p>
          <p>
          Unlike other hackathons, Hummus Hacks brings together people who have a passion for technology AND hummus. 
          Join us for events like the Hummus Spa, Getting started with ML and the Hummus Dataset, or the ever-popular Make-your-own at Midnight!
          Though not required, we recommend choosing a project that involves hummus. Check out our Hack Ideas for inspiration. 
          We can’t wait to see what you’ll create!
          </p>
          <p>
          There is no hummus without us. Together we can change the world, one hack at a time.
